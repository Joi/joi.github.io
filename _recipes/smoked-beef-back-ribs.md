<div class="box box-notes"><p>Note: I recommend placing the wrapped ribs into a cookie sheet or pan to prevent any runaway leaks.</p>
<p>The next morning, remove the ribs from the fridge, unwrap them from the plastic and lay them in a Bradley rack or cookie sheet in preparation for transporting them out to the smoker.</p>
