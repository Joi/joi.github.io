description: "Traditional home cooking from the Philippines. Easy to make and very\
  \ tasty - a kind of umami bomb of amino acid flavors. \n\nYou can make this without\
  \ the pork or the shrimp. You can also add tofu. I would suggest harder tofu, chopping\
  \ the tofu into squares or rectangles and frying before adding to stir fry.\n\n\
  Instead of bok choy, you can use other strong leafy greens such as Chinese cabbage.\n\

<div class="box box-notes"><p>You can add more protein. I made it with a lb of pork and a lb of shrimp and it was great.</p>
<p>Works well with asparagus too. <img src="/images/recipes/ginisang-pechay-with-ground-pork-and-shrimp-6.jpg" alt="6" /></p>

<li>1 lb bok choy cleaned and chopped</li>

<li>1 medium tomato diced</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion diced</li>

<p><img src="/images/recipes/ginisang-pechay-with-ground-pork-and-shrimp-2.jpg" alt="2" /></p>
<p>Chop the onion, garlic and tomato and put in a bowl or vat. Chop the bok choy and shrimp and put in another bowl or vat.</p>
<p>Heat wok and target the [[Leidenfrost effect]].</p>
<p>Add oil to pan and add onion, garlic and tomato and sauté.</p>
<p>Add ground pork and sauté until brown.</p>
<p>Add shrimp and bok choy and stir-fry for 3 - 5 min until the bok choy is tender, but not soft. If you want, you can separate the leafy part from the thick stems and add them a min or two after the thick parts.</p>
<p>Add chicken broth (or water if you don't have any) and bring to boil. Cover and simmer for 2 - 3 min.</p>
<p>Add fish sauce and ground black pepper.</p>
<p>Chinese chicken soup broth usually has a lot of salt in it so you may not need salt. If you use stock or broth without salt, you may need to add some. Season to taste at end.</p>
