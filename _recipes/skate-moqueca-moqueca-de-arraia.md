description: "One of the most popular ways to serve arraia (ray or skate in English)\
  \ in Brazil comes from the northeastern state of Bahia, specifically from the Afro-Brazilian\
  \ culinary traditions of Salvador, the state's capital city and Brazil's original\
  \ capital.\n\nIn traditional Bahian cuisine, a thick stew made from fish or seafood\
  \ in a broth of tomatoes, onions, coconut milk and the brilliant-orange palm oil\
  \ known as dend\xEA is called a moqueca. The word moqueca and the recipe both come\
  \ from Africa and the tradition of cooking fish in moquecas crossed the Atlantic\
  \ to Brazil in the hold of slave ships which carried Africans to slavery in the\
  \ mines and sugar cane plantations of Brazil.\n\nThis recipe for moqueca de arraia\
  \ (moqueca of skate or ray) comes from the SENAC cooking school in Salvador, and\
  \ is a typical moqueca. There are as many recipes for moqueca as there are cooks,\
  \ but the ingredients used in this recipe are found in some combination in almost\
  \ every recipe.\n\nDend\xEA palm oil has a distinctive color and flavor and there\
  \ really is no substitute for it, although substituting 2 or 3 tablespoons of sweet\
  \ paprika will give the final dish almost the same color. However one of the most\
  \ important flavor components will be missing when dend\xEA is absent. In cities\
  \ that have a Brazilian immigrant community, markets that cater to Brazilians will\
  \ likely have dend\xEA in stock, and in cities with an African immigrant population\
  \ you can often find dend\xEA in African markets, labeled simply palm oil."
