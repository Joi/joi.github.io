description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nWhen you\u2019re frying chicken for a crowd,\
  \ it\u2019s easy to overlook the copious amounts of oil necessary to achieve juicy,\
  \ tender meat and a supercrispy coating. Not so when you\u2019re cooking for two.\
  \ To scale things down to size, we transfer the operation from a Dutch oven to a\
  \ 10-inch skillet that uses 1\xBD cups (rather than 2 to 3 quarts) of oil and flip\
  \ the chicken pieces during cooking to ensure even browning. We cover the skillet\
  \ for the first few minutes to make sure the chicken cooks through and then uncover\
  \ it to let the crust dry. Since batters tended to stick to the bottom of the pan\
  \ with this shallow-fry method, we opt instead for a seasoned flour blend and a\
  \ brief buttermilk soak. Mixing some buttermilk into the flour blend creates shaggy\
  \ shards of coating that fry into an extra-crunchy crust."
