description: I often say that my favorite food is the sort that can, at once, comfort,
  surprise, and delight. This dish (as is often the case with meatballs) does all
  these things for me. The meatballs have all the comfort of a home-cooked meal, with
  the lemon and celery root providing the surprise and delight. These are lovely as
  they are, served with some couscous or rice to soak up the juices, or with a little
  bit of Greek-style yogurt on the side. The dish can be made a day in advance and
  kept in the fridge. Reheat before serving.
