description: Minestrone is a mellow vegetable soup, and its composition depends on
  the best vegetables available. This minestrone is all vegetables-healthful and inexpensive.
  For a true vegetarian soup, use water instead of chicken stock. While many versions
  of minestrone are thick, this one is light and thin. The composite taste is a blend
  of all the elements, but each vegetable also keeps its separate identity.
