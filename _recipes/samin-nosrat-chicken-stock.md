description: "Stock With stock on hand, dinner is always within reach. A tasty, simple,\
  \ quick dinner that can take one of countless forms\u2014soup, yes of course, but\
  \ also stuffing and panade , a gratin made with bread and abundant stock. Or grains\
  \ cooked in stock, which deliver flavor and protein without relying on meat. Or\
  \ a poached egg and just-wilted spinach drowned in stock. And then, of course, there\
  \ are the endless braises, soups, and stews that stock will enrich.\n\nEvery time\
  \ you roast a chicken, cut off the neck or head, feet, and wingtips (and even the\
  \ backbone, when spatchcocking ) before salting, and throw them all into the freezer\
  \ in a plastic bag. Then, after dinner, add the carcass into the plastic bag. One\
  \ chicken carcass isn\u2019t really enough to warrant a pot of stock, so save up\
  \ three or four and make stock every month or two. You can also save onion ends,\
  \ the last stalk of celery that\u2019s about to go rubbery, parsley stems, and carrot\
  \ ends and store these in a bag in the freezer. When your freezer can no longer\
  \ contain the mess, empty it all out into a big pot and prepare to make stock.\n\
  \nIf all you have on hand is roasted bones, it\u2019s worth making a trek out to\
  \ the butcher shop to buy a few pounds of chicken heads and feet, or some wingtips.\
  \ The gelatin the raw bones contain will add a ton of body and richness to the stock."
