<div class="columns large-7 small-12" id="writeup">		<div id="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<div class="box box-notes"><p>Serve as Appetizer: To serve as a warm appetizer, transfer calamari to a serving platter, and serve with slices for fresh French baguette or crostini (it will serve 6 to 8).</p>
<p>Serve as Dinner: Serve this calamari for dinner as part of a big seafood feast next to other dishes like roasted red snapper; roasted mackerel; Sicilian fish stew; or baked salmon. For a simple dinner, just serve this saucy calamari over your favorite grain, pasta, or Lebanese rice. Add a large fattoush salad to complete the meal.</p>
<p>Cook’s Tip for Leftover Calamari: This recipe is best enjoyed immediately. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for 2 nights or so, but I don’t recommend reheating calamari; overcooked calamari can be rubbery.</p>
