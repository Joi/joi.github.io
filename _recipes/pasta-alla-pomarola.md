description: "Ever since that sauce-making competition at Chez Panisse, I\u2019ve\
  \ learned dozens and dozens of different methods for making basic tomato sauce,\
  \ but the truth of the matter is that all of the variations\u2014using onion or\
  \ not, adding basil or oregano, pur\xE9eing or milling\u2014offer little more than\
  \ personal flourish. You can do it however you like; most important is to use the\
  \ best-tasting tomatoes and olive oil you can find, and to get the salt right. Do\
  \ that, and you\u2019ve got yourself a wonderful blank slate, ready to use in pasta\
  \ and pizza, of course, but also in  dishes as diverse as shakshuka , braised Moroccan\
  \ lamb, Mexican rice, or Proven\xE7al fish stew."
