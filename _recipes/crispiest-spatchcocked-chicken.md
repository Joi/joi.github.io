description: "Two tricks make this simple recipe the most extraordinary way I know\
  \ to cook a whole chicken. First, spatchcocking. Spatchcocking is the term for removing\
  \ a bird\u2019s backbone and then splaying it so it lies flat, but I like to think\
  \ of it as a way to increase surface area for browning while decreasing cooking\
  \ time. (It\u2019s also my favorite way to cook Thanksgiving turkey, cutting down\
  \ cooking time by nearly half!\n\nThe second trick is one I stumbled on by mistake\
  \ at Eccolo, when one of my cooks seasoned a few chickens and left them uncovered\
  \ in the walk-in overnight. When I came in the next day, I was annoyed by his negligence.\
  \ The constantly circulating air of the walk-in\u2014like that of any refrigerator\u2014\
  had dried out the chicken skin, and the birds looked scarily fossilized. But I had\
  \ no choice, so I cooked them anyway. The dried-out skin cooked up golden and glassy.\
  \ It was the crispiest roast chicken skin I\u2019d ever seen, even after the bird\
  \ had rested. If you don\u2019t have a chance to season the chicken and let its\
  \ skin dry out overnight, season it as early as possible, then pat it dry with a\
  \ paper towel before you begin to cook it. It\u2019ll help achieve a similar effect."
