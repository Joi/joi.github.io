description: "How often do you get roasted potatoes that look like they\u2019re going\
  \ to be awesomely crisp only to find that rather than crispness, all you\u2019ve\
  \ got is a papery (or worse, leathery) skin on the exterior?\n\nRoasting potatoes\
  \ is not quite as easy as roasting most other vegetables. See, with roast potatoes,\
  \ we\u2019ve got a different set of goals than when, say, roasting Brussels sprouts.\
  \ First off, we want the potatoes to be cooked through all the way to the center.\
  \ Fluffy and moist is what we\u2019re after. Second, we want the exterior to be\
  \ extremely crisp. We\u2019re talking crisper-than-a-French-fry crisp. Simply toss\
  \ a potato coated with a bit of oil in the oven, and what you end up with is a potato\
  \ with a paper-thin sheath of crispness around its exterior that very rapidly softens\
  \ and turns leathery as internal moisture seeps through it.\n\nSo, what makes a\
  \ potato crisp? The answer is building up a dehydrated layer of gelatinized starch\
  \ on the exterior of the spud, much like when you fry a French fry (s e e here).\
  \ To do this, you\u2019ve got to parcook them, allowing their starches to soften\
  \ and expand, and then recrystallize by cooling them a bit.\n\nOur secondary goal\
  \ is to increase their surface area. Craggy, uneven surfaces crisp up a lot better\
  \ than smooth ones. Luckily, we can kill two birds with one stone here. By boiling\
  \ your potatoes before you roast them, not only do you ensure that their outer layers\
  \ of starch are properly gelatinized, you also soften their exteriors enough that\
  \ they get a bit battered and bruised when you toss them around with oil before\
  \ roasting them. This creates a sort of potato-oil paste that adds plenty of surface\
  \ area and acts almost like a batter for fried foods, creating an extra layer of\
  \ crispness as the potatoes roast.\n\nTake a look at these potatoes, roasted side\
  \ by side in the same oven. One batch was started raw, another was boiled first,\
  \ and the third was boiled, then roughed. The difference is obvious.\n\nNext question:\
  \ What\u2019s the best fat to use? People often tout the awesomeness of duck fat\
  \ with potatoes, and for good reason: it tastes awesome. Duck fat has a distinct\
  \ richness and aroma that gets absorbed very easily into the surface of a spud.\
  \ On top of that, it\u2019s got plenty of saturated fat and a high smoke point,\
  \ which makes it an ideal medium for crisping up fried or roasted foods. (In general,\
  \ the higher the saturated fat content of an oil, the more efficiently it\u2019\
  ll crisp foods.) Can\u2019t get duck fat? Well, turkey fat or chicken fat collected\
  \ from roasted birds will do just fine.\n\nBacon fat and rendered lard are also\
  \ fine choices, as is just about any sort of animal-derived fat.\n\nIf you must,\
  \ extra-virgin olive oil will certainly do admirably well, though you won\u2019\
  t get quite the same level of crispness you\u2019d get with an animal fat.\n\nOnce\
  \ your potatoes are tossed in fat and seasoned well, all you\u2019ve got to do is\
  \ roast them in an extremely hot oven until they crisp up. I roast mine on an unlined\
  \ heavy rimmed baking sheet (they have a tendency to stick to foil). The key is\
  \ to make sure you let the undersides crisp up completely before you even attempt\
  \ to lift or flip them. If the potatoes don\u2019t come off relatively easily, you\
  \ run the risk of breaking off the tops, leaving the crisp bottoms cemented to the\
  \ bottom of the pan. This is not an ideal situation.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: Your\
  \ potatoes will release themselves from the pan when they\u2019re good and ready.\
  \ Don\u2019t force them."
