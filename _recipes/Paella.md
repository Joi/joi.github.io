<li>4 ½ cups chicken stock</li>

</div>	</div>	<div class="medium-6 small-7 columns" id="directions"><h4>Directions</h4><div class="box box-directions content"><p>1 Preheat the grill or oven to 375ºF.</p>
<p>Put crumbled saffron In a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Add saffron and salt. Turn off heat and steep saffron for 15 minutes. Season with salt.</p>
<p>In a cast iron skillet, heat oil, sauté onion and red pepper until soft. (5 min or so) Add garlic and chorizo.</p>
<p>Put the skillet on the grill or to stove. Add rice and stir until coated with oil and lightly toasted. 4 min or so.</p>
<p>Add stock and tomato. Add salt. Salt is difficult because the sauce will reduce and the rice will absorb, but error on the side of slightly salty at this point.</p>
<p>Close grill cover or oven door and simmer rice for 15 min or so until the stock is absorbed. If necessary, add boiling water. Do not stir.</p>
<p>Add seafood. Mussels and clams should be hinge side up so the juices go into the rice.</p>
<p>Cover pan with foil or lid and close grill or oven and cook for 6 - 10 min until rice and shrimp are done.</p>
<p>Remove when done and sprinkle with parsley.</p>
<p>Serve in the pan.</p>
