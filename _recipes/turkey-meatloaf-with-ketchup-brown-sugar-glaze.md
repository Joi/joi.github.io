description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nStore-bought ground turkey is fine and pasty,\
  \ and it produced a dense, mushy meatloaf when we simply swapped it into a traditional\
  \ meatloaf recipe. We dropped the usual panade from our recipe since we found that\
  \ it only exacerbated the mushiness. Instead, we stirred in quick oats, which added\
  \ just the right amount of chew and helped open up the texture of the densely packed\
  \ turkey. To help give the turkey\u2019s thin juices richer flavor and fuller body,\
  \ we added cornstarch to the mix along with grated Parmesan cheese and butter, and\
  \ we used egg yolks instead of whole eggs. To avoid overwhelming the mild flavor\
  \ of the meat with too many add-ins, we stirred in a modest amount of onion, as\
  \ well as garlic, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and Dijon mustard. To finish it off,\
  \ we made a flavor-packed glaze and ensured that it stuck by applying a first coat\
  \ to the meatloaf and letting it cook until the glaze was tacky. We then added a\
  \ second coat of glaze, which stuck to this base coat in an even layer. To help\
  \ the loaf cook evenly, we baked it on an aluminum foil\u2013lined wire rack set\
  \ in a rimmed baking sheet."
