<div class="columns large-7 small-12" id="writeup">		<div id="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<div class="box box-notes"><p>Marinate in fridge for 2 hours, take out for 30 min to allow to come to room temp. Meanwhile, preheat the grill to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're using a gas grill, turn off the burner on one side. If you're using charcoal, move the coals to one side of the grill. Clean the grill with a grill brush, then dip a paper towel in vegetable oil or canola oil, and using tongs, wipe the grill with the oiled paper towel. Place the steaks on the indirect heat side (the side without the flame), and close the grill's lid. You'll need to maintain the temperature at a steady 250 degrees Fahrenheit, so keep an eye on the temperature and increase the heat if necessary.</p>
<p>Using a meat thermometer, cook the steaks until they hit 10 degrees lower than your desired doneness. For example, for medium doneness, the internal temperature needs to be 140 degrees, so take the steaks off the grill when they register 130 degrees. A hanger steak that's three-quarters of an inch thick will take between 15 and 20 minutes to hit 130 degrees. A thinner steak will take less time, so check its temperature after the first seven minutes, and keep checking regularly after that.</p>
