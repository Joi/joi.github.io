description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nWe started with a simple stir-together dough\
  \ of bread flour, salt, yeast, and warm water; the warm water jump-started yeast\
  \ activity so that the crumb was open and light. Instead of kneading the dough,\
  \ we let it rest overnight in the refrigerator. During this rest, the dough's gluten\
  \ strengthened enough for the crust to support the toppings but still have a tender\
  \ crumb. Baking the pie in a generously oiled cast-iron skillet \u201Cfried\u201D\
  \ the outside of the crust. We also moved the skillet to the stove for the last\
  \ few minutes of cooking to crisp up the underside of the crust. For the crispy\
  \ cheese edge known as frico, we pressed shredded Monterey Jack cheese around the\
  \ edge of the dough and up the sides of the skillet. For the sauce, we crushed canned\
  \ whole tomatoes (which are less processed and therefore fresher-tasting than commercial\
  \ crushed tomatoes) by hand, which allowed some of their juice to drain so the sauce\
  \ would be thick enough to stay put on the pie, and then pureed them in the food\
  \ processor with classic seasonings\u2014no cooking required."
