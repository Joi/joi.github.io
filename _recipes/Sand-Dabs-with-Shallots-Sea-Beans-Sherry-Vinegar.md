description: "A RICHLY FLAVORED PANFRY THAT HAS A PUNGENT, DELICIOUS AROMA. \u201C\
  Sea beans\u201D are glasswort, a crunchy, briny marsh succulent. We use fresh sea\
  \ beans in the late spring when they are briefly in season, and pickled ones the\
  \ rest of the year {see Pickled Glasswort, here}. You can substitute capers or caperberries.\
  \ In lieu of sand dabs, a mild, succulent flatfish that is a San Francisco delicacy,\
  \ you can use small, whole, pan-ready sole or flounder. By \u201Cpan-ready,\u201D\
  \ I mean gutted, scaled, head and tail removed, and fins trimmed. Filleted fish\
  \ is an option as well, but adjust the cooking time accordingly, and be prepared\
  \ for it to curl as it cooks. Skate wing is another good choice~the skate in black\
  \ butter of French tradition is the obvious inspiration for this dish.\n\nA large\
  \ nonstick skillet is the best choice here. If you don\u2019t have one, clarify\
  \ half of the butter {see Note below} before you brown the fish in it {or any time\
  \ you plan to pan-brown a wet protein or starch in butter}. To keep wet fish from\
  \ sticking to a non-nonstick pan, you need to use higher heat, and the solids in\
  \ whole butter would burn at that temperature. Clarifying also removes the water,\
  \ which makes food stick, from the butter.\n\nIf you are new to panfrying fragile\
  \ things, you should opt for the larger fish~it will be easier to manage 4 sizzling,\
  \ slippery objects than 8. Serve with new potatoes, boiled or steamed in their skins."
