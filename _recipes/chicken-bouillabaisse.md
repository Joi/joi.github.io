description: "this is an easy, crowd-pleasing dish I owe to Madeleine Serraille, sister\
  \ of the famous fr\xE8res Troisgros. It is one of the distracting dishes her brother\
  \ Jean would sniff and sample when he happened by her house on his way back to the\
  \ restaurant to cook salmon in sorrel sauce and steak \xE0 la moelle. Madeleine\
  \ claimed it was from Ali-Bab\u2019s Gastronomie Pratique, an idiosyncratic elevenpound\
  \ treasury of French cooking that she insisted I buy and study the summer before\
  \ I went to college.\n\nA\xEFoli gives this dish richness along with a jolt of garlic;\
  \ a lighter alternative is to rub the hot toasted bread with raw garlic.\n"
