description: "I clearly remember the first time I battered and fried fish; the way\
  \ the batter puffed up when it hit the hot oil seemed like a miracle. Considering\
  \ how frying had always intimidated me, the way the fish turned out\u2014crisp and\
  \ delicious\u2014was an even bigger miracle. By the time I had frying down , about\
  \ a decade into my frying career, I came across British chef Heston Blumenthal\u2019\
  s recipe for fried fish. By replacing some of the water in the batter with vodka,\
  \ which is only about 60 percent water, he reduced the amount of water available\
  \ to create gluten. As a result, the crust is unbelievably tender. By adding fizzy\
  \ beer and baking powder to the batter, and keeping everything ice-cold, he tipped\
  \ the scales even further in favor of lightness. As a result, the crust is even\
  \ more unbelievably tender. Some might call it, you know, a miracle."
