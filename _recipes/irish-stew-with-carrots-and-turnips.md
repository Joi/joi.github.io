description: 'WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS

  For a lamb stew recipe with real flavor, finding the right cut of meat was half
  the battle. We found that slicing the meat off the bone from a lamb shoulder chop,
  browning it, and adding the bones and meat to the stewing liquid gave us a great
  lamb stew recipe with a rich-tasting broth and the velvety texture that only marrow-rich
  bones can contribute.'
