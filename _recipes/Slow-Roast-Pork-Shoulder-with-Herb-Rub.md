<div class="box box-notes"><p>6/18/20:</p>
<p>Brined, added fennel seeds, fronds and lemon zest to rub. 200 ºF until 180 ºF internal temp then let rest for 15 min - heat oven to to 500 ºF and roast for 5 min and let cool for another 15 min.</p>
<p>Pan sauce:</p>
<p>When the pork's finished, drain off and discard the excess fat and deglaze the rimmed baking sheet by heating it over a single burner and adding two cups of white wine, chicken stock, or a combination of both. Scrape up browned bits, transfer to a small saucepan, season to taste, and whisk in two tablespoons butter off heat.</p>
<p>From comments:</p>
<p>I gave this 5 stars, but with one caveat, use this on a 3-3.5lb pork shoulder instead of a 7lb one. I didn't read ahead that the recipe was for a 7lb pork shoulder, so I didn't half the recipe (just the time that I cooked it for). It came out perfectly done, and seasoned. I feel like if I used this on a 7lb pork shoulder that it would come out way under seasoned. For 3.5lb I cooked it on 200 degrees for 6 hours, and it came out with that perfect &quot;pulled pork&quot; consistency.</p>

<p>Temperature:</p>
<p>160F sufficient... 180F target when remove from oven and let rest until 190F.</p>
