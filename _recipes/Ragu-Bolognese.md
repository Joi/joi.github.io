description: "A rag\xFA is a meat sauce that is usually made with beef or veal, but\
  \ can also be made from chicken, duckling, turkey, rabbit or lamb. Traditionally\
  \ argue was made only at home and every self-respecting Italian housewife would\
  \ start cooking her rag\xFA early in the morning and let it cook very slowly for\
  \ at least 4 hours. Naples is particularly famous for its rag\xFA.\n\nIt is very\
  \ rare to find a restaurant that serves a good rag\xFA. The rag\xFA takes a long\
  \ time to make, but it should be eaten within a few hours. Unfortunately many restaurants\
  \ like to keep their rag\xFA on hand for days at a time. At Harry's Bar we always\
  \ make the sauce the day we serve it.\n\nRag\xFA - sometimes called Bolognese sauce\
  \ - is good with any pasta, but I think fusilli are best."
