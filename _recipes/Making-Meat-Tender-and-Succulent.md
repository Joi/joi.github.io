<div class="large-8 medium-7 columns" id="writeup">		<div id="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<div class="box box-notes"><p>Depending on the size or the cut of meat, you might want to heat the oven to 275 F or even 250 F.</p>
<p>If you are braising shanks, you can make a few vertical (parallel to the bone) cuts in the outer membrane so that the meat will not twist out of shape while it braises. Some chefs remove the membrane altogether, but it a lot of work and usually not worth it. A lengthy braise will pretty much dissolve the membrane.</p>
<p>Oven braising is best because the meat is cooked with indirect heat. But if you do not have an oven-safe pot, you can braise on the stovetop over low heat. You will have to check it periodically to make sure the liquid is simmering and not boiling.</p>
<p>To cool and store braised meat, it is best to leave the meat in the braising liquid so that it does not dry out.</p>
