description: "_Ossobuco_  - one of Italy's most delicious dishes is made with shanks\
  \ of milk-fed veal that are sliced and braised in a well-flavored broth until they\
  \ are tender enough to eat with a fork. The name means \"bone with a hole.\" Each\
  \ slice of veal shows a cross section of the shank: a ring of meat surrounds a round\
  \ section of shank bone with its center \"hole\" filled with marrow. After long\
  \ cooking this marrow develops its characteristic texture and incomparable flavor.\n\
  \r_Ossobuco_ is a true classic of the Milanese cuisine and is traditionally served\
  \ with _Risotto alla Milanese_ , made with saffron. I love a saffron _risotto_,\
  \ but I think that a plain risotto with freshly grated Parmesan goes even better\
  \ with _ossobuco_  because it doesn't interfere with the extremely subtle flavor\
  \ of the meat and the meat juices.\n\r_Gremolada_ - a garnish of chopped herbs and\
  \ other seasonings is sprinkled over the _ossobuco_ before serving. Each chef has\
  \ his own preferred formula for _gremolada_.\n\r_Ossobuco_ has only one drawback\
  \ - it cannot be reheated the next day. For this reason we have it on the menu only\
  \ once a week - on Sundays . There are several restaurants in Milan that do serve\
  \ _ossobuco_ every day, and that makes me suspicious! It's surely no coincidence\
  \ that every Sunday at least 20 customers come from Milan to eat our _ossobuco_,\
  \ freshly prepared that very morning.\n\rAsk your butcher for hind shanks, which\
  \ are meatier and more tender than the front ones . Have the shanks cut into 1 \xBD\
  \ to 2-inch ( 4 to 5 cm) pieces if they are whole. Sliced shanks can be found in\
  \ many supermarket meat departments. Don't remove the membrane around the shanks,\
  \ it will help them keep their shape during cooking.\n\rMake a good broth with meat\
  \ bones and trimmings and keep it hot to use in both the _ossobuco_ and the _risotto_.\
  \ For added richness in the _risotto_, scoop the marrow out of the end pieces of\
  \ the veal shanks after they are cooked. Melt this with the butter before adding\
  \ the rice. Guests can then enjoy the marrow at the center of their veal shanks\
  \ and also its subtle flavor in the risotto."

<div class="box box-notes"><p>Unfortunately, this recipe is not online, but only in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harrys-Bar-Cookbook-Reminiscences-World-Famous/dp/0553070304/">the book</a>. The rough directions are to sear the shanks in oil and remove them from the Dutch oven and drain the oil. Then sauté the vegetables. Add wine and deglaze. Then add the tomato and stock. Make sure the meat is mostly covered with the braising liquid.Then put the Dutch oven in the oven at 300ºF for 3 hours. (In an Anova oven, set to 50% steam and leave the lid off.)</p>
<p>Once the meat is fork tender, plate onto heated plates and put the Dutch oven on the stove. Boil down if too thick. Add the gremolada and stir for about a minute and spoon sauce over meat.</p>
