description: "_Ossobuco_  - one of Italy's most delicious dishes is made with shanks\
  \ of milk-fed veal that are sliced and braised in a well-flavored broth until they\
  \ are tender enough to eat with a fork. The name means \"bone with a hole.\" Each\
  \ slice of veal shows a cross section of the shank: a ring of meat surrounds a round\
  \ section of shank bone with its center \"hole\" filled with marrow. After long\
  \ cooking this marrow develops its characteristic texture and incomparable flavor.\n\
  \r_Ossobuco_ is a true classic of the Milanese cuisine and is traditionally served\
  \ with _Risotto alla Milanese_ , made with saffron. I love a saffron _risotto_,\
  \ but I think that a plain risotto with freshly grated Parmesan goes even better\
  \ with _ossobuco_  because it doesn't interfere with the extremely subtle flavor\
  \ of the meat and the meat juices.\n\r_Gremolada_ - a garnish of chopped herbs and\
  \ other seasonings is sprinkled over the _ossobuco_ before serving. Each chef has\
  \ his own preferred formula for _gremolada_.\n\r_Ossobuco_ has only one drawback\
  \ - it cannot be reheated the next day. For this reason we have it on the menu only\
  \ once a week - on Sundays . There are several restaurants in Milan that do serve\
  \ _ossobuco_ every day, and that makes me suspicious! It's surely no coincidence\
  \ that every Sunday at least 20 customers come from Milan to eat our _ossobuco_,\
  \ freshly prepared that very morning.\n\rAsk your butcher for hind shanks, which\
  \ are meatier and more tender than the front ones . Have the shanks cut into 1 \xBD\
  \ to 2-inch ( 4 to 5 cm) pieces if they are whole. Sliced shanks can be found in\
  \ many supermarket meat departments. Don't remove the membrane around the shanks,\
  \ it will help them keep their shape during cooking.\n\rMake a good broth with meat\
  \ bones and trimmings and keep it hot to use in both the _ossobuco_ and the _risotto_.\
  \ For added richness in the _risotto_, scoop the marrow out of the end pieces of\
  \ the veal shanks after they are cooked. Melt this with the butter before adding\
  \ the rice. Guests can then enjoy the marrow at the center of their veal shanks\
  \ and also its subtle flavor in the risotto."
