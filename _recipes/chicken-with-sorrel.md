<div class="row" id="row-two">	<div class="columns large-4 small-12" id="ingredients"><h4>Ingredients</h4><div class="box box-ingredients content"><ul>
<li>1 Tbsp light oil</li>
<li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
<li>1 2 ½ - to 3-pound chicken, cut into serving pieces</li>
<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 large or 2 medium onions, peeled and cut into ¼-inch slices</li>
<li>6 cups loosely packed sorrel, about ½ lb, trimmed and washed</li>
</ul>
</div>	</div>	<div class="columns large-6 small-12" id="directions"><h4>Directions</h4><div class="box box-directions content"><p>Break down chicken into 10 parts - drum stick, thighs, breast into 4 parts, wings. Save the back and wing tips for stock.</p>
<p>Dry brine chicken with salt and pepper overnight.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 300 if using.</p>
<p>Before cooking, dredge chicken pieces in flour (or not). I add a bit of extra salt and pepper, but not too much since it's dry brined.</p>
<p>In a Dutch oven, add a bit of light olive oil and sear chicken. 4 min per side, 2 batches.</p>
<p>Add butter, sauté the onions until soft but still holding their shape.</p>
<p>Put thighs and drumsticks in skin side up and bring to simmer. Cover and cook for 8 minutes. Add broad big pieces skin side down. Cover and cook until big breast pieces have an internal temperature of 105ºF to 115ºF degrees, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Add sorel and stir in. Turn big breast pieces skin side up. Add smaller tapered breast pieces, skin side up. Transfer covered pot to oven or simmer and cook until breast pieces have an internal temperature of 150ºF and dark meat is 160ºF, 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
