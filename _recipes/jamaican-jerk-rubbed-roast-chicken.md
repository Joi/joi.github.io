description: "Jerk-style chicken is a specialty of Jamaica, where the chicken gets\
  \ a wonderful smoky-sweet flavor from being slow-cooked over fresh pimento wood\
  \ or laurel wood\u2014 the tree that bay leaves come from. We don\u2019t have access\
  \ to those ingredients in our kitchens, but we do have what it takes to make the\
  \ spicy allspice-scented marinade. Rather than roast the bird over laurel wood,\
  \ I do the next best thing: roast it surrounded on all sides by thyme and bay leaves.\
  \ Using the butterflied method gets you gorgeously crisp, charred skin."

<div class="large-8 medium-7 columns" id="writeup">		<div id="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<div class="box box-notes"><p>NOTES: For the juiciest results and best skin, dry-brine the bird and air-dry it overnight as described here. Be extremely careful working with Scotch bonnets or habaneros: they are very hot and their oil can cause skin and eye irritations. Use a separate cutting board, wear latex gloves if you have them, and wash all surfaces and knives immediately after slicing them.</p>
