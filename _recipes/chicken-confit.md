description: "Take a page out of the French farmwife\u2019s handbook and keep confit\
  \ on hand to save you from dinnertime desperation. Easy enough to make while you\
  \ watch a movie or do the Sunday crossword, there\u2019s no reason not to try this\
  \ recipe. I make a big batch once or twice each winter. I just stick it in the fridge,\
  \ where it quickly makes its way to the back of the bottom shelf, a spot I rarely\
  \ think to look. But I inevitably find it just when I need it most\u2014when an\
  \ unexpected friend shows up for dinner, or I just can\u2019t muster the energy\
  \ to cook. And, every time, I give silent thanks to that thoughtful, industrious\
  \ earlier version of myself. You will, too.\n\nIf you can\u2019t find or make duck\
  \ fat, pure olive oil will work just fine. But if you do make the effort to find\
  \ or render your own duck fat, you\u2019ll be rewarded in flavor. (There aren\u2019\
  t many other uses for duck fat in the kitchen, but for roasting or frying potatoes,\
  \ the excess fat from confit is an unforgettable one.) Serve the chicken and potatoes\
  \ with a pile of arugula or chicories dressed in a bright, Honey-Mustard Vinaigrette\
  \ (page 240 ) and spoonfuls of Herb Salsa for a welcome acidic contrast."
