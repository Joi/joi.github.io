<div class="large-8 medium-7 columns" id="writeup">		<div id="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<div class="box box-notes"><p>Use chicken stock as the liquid base. Not only will this complement the seafood flavor, but it will add a gentle sweetness to the dish.</p>
<p>Simmer for longer. The longer it cooks on low heat, the softer the abalone will become. If you're using fresh abalone, 1 hour will be enough.</p>
<p>Make sure all the ingredients are submerged in liquid the entire braising time. This will prevent drying out and keep everything moist and juicy. Add more water if needed.</p>
<p>You can get fresh abalone from the fish monger. Ask for them to clean and deshell each one for you, then give it a second clean at home (like how we did in our Buddha Jumps Over The Wall Soup).</p>
<p>For this recipe, we used frozen abalone from the fish market.</p>
