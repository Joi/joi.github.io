description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nWe wanted to combine the ease of cream biscuits\
  \ (which eliminate the step of cutting cold fat into dry ingredients) with the ease\
  \ of drop biscuits (which skip the rolling and cutting) to create the easiest biscuits\
  \ ever. But the most obvious solution\u2014increasing the amount of cream in a cream\
  \ biscuit recipe until the dough had a droppable consistency\u2014produced biscuits\
  \ that spread too much and were greasy. Instead of increasing the amount of cream,\
  \ we found a way to increase its fluidity: We heated it to between 95 and 100 degrees,\
  \ which melted the solid particles of butterfat dispersed throughout. This made\
  \ a dough that was moister and scoopable but that rose up instead of spreading out\
  \ in the oven, producing biscuits that were appropriately rich and tender but not\
  \ greasy."
