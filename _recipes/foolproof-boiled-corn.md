description: "To produce perfectly crisp, juicy corn every time, we figured out that\
  \ the ideal doneness range is 150 to 170 degrees\u2014when the starches have gelatinized\
  \ but a minimum amount of the pectin (the glue that holds the cell walls together)\
  \ has dissolved. Consistently cooking the corn to that temperature was easy once\
  \ we realized that we shouldn\u2019t boil the corn. Instead, we used a hack sous\
  \ vide method: bringing a measured amount of water (4 quarts) to a boil, shutting\
  \ off the heat, dropping in six ears of corn, and letting the corn stand for at\
  \ least 10 minutes. The temperature of the water decreased quickly enough that there\
  \ was never any chance of the corn overcooking, while the temperature of the corn\
  \ increased to the ideal zone. Even better, the method is flexible: It can accommodate\
  \ between six and eight ears of different sizes, and the corn can sit in the water\
  \ for as long as 30 minutes without overcooking."
