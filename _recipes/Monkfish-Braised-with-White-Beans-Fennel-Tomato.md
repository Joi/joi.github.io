description: 'THIS DISH REAPPEARS IN A NUMBER OF FORMS AT ZUNI, SOMETIMES WITH THICKLY
  sliced boiled potatoes instead of beans, or with house-salted cod in lieu of monkfish,
  or with big chunks of blanched leeks in place of the fennel. In summer, we shove
  a bouquet of basil stems into the tomato sauce, or stir whole leaves into the simmering
  sauce just before baking it. In any variation, the recipe is forgiving with regard
  to exact amounts, so long as each of the elements is delicious to begin with. And
  succulent, meaty monkfish is fairly forgiving with regard to cooking time.


  If you plan to make the fumet, ask for monkfish bones when you buy the fillets.
  (The fumet will take less than an hour to make.) You can cook the beans a day or
  two in advance.'
