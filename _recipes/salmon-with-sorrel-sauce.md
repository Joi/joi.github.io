description: "There aren't that many recipes for the spring-only sorrel on the Internet,\
  \ but one that I see a lot is for Salmon with Sorrel sauce[^first]. They seem to\
  \ be based on the L\xE1 Troigros Sorrel recipe. I pulled a few of them together\
  \ in this recipe.\n\n[^first]: [Sorrel Sauce for Fish a L\xE1 Troigros](https://www.highgroundorganics.com/recipes/sorrel-sauce-for-fish-a-la-troigros/)\
  \ and [Salmon and Sorrel Sauce](https://www.signaturedishes.net/recipes/salmon-sorrel-sauce.html)\
  \ are a few examples."

ingredients: "1 \xBD pounds Salmon filets\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n1 Tbsp\
  \ extra-virgin olive oil\n3 Tbsp finely chopped shallot\n1 cup dry white wine (you\
  \ can also use ros\xE9; the sauce will have a pink hue)\n\n1 medium bunch sorrel\
  \ (around 4 oz by weight), stems removed gently with a knife (pulling the stems\
  \ as for kale will bruise the sorrel and discolor it, helping the sauce to turn\
  \ khaki and taste like hay\n2 medium shallots, minced\n6 Tbsp (3 ounces) dry white\
  \ wine, preferably un-oaked sauvignon blanc\n3 Tbsp (1\xBD ounces) white Noilly\
  \ Prat (or other high quality) white vermouth[^vermouth]\n1 qt vegetable stock,\
  \ fish stock if you\u2019ve got it\n1 3x3 inch square dashi-kombu, wiped with a\
  \ damp paper towel and the edges pinked with kitchen scissors[^kombu]\n1\xBD cups\
  \ cr\xE8me fraiche if you have it, or use heavy cream\n2 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut\
  \ into pea-sized bits and kept cold\nSalt and pepper (white pepper preferred for\
  \ color as well as flavor, but not a deal breaker) [^whitepepper]\nJuice of half\
  \ a lemon, as needed\n[^vermouth]: Chef\u2019s Notes from High Ground Organics site:\
  \ The vermouth adds depth and some sweetness to the sauce. Cheap vermouth can be\
  \ harsh or bitter, and the herbs and spices in them just are not very pleasant when\
  \ reduced. I opted for Noilly Prat because it is a French product in a French dish,\
  \ but any good quality white vermouth will work.\n[^kombu]: Dashi-kombu is a seaweed\
  \ found in Japanese markets and health food stores. Kombu adds an oceanic quality\
  \ missing if you do not have fish fumet. It also helps to add viscosity to the sauce.\n\
  [^whitepepper]: White pepper will blend into the sauce better, and has a slightly\
  \ higher pitched flavor/aroma than black pepper, so it is called for here."

</div>	</div>	<div class="medium-6 small-7 columns" id="directions"><h4>Directions</h4><div class="box box-directions content"><p>Cook fish, salmon is a good fish to use, your favorite way. I like to reverse sear it by using my Anova Precision oven to get the inner temperature to about 115ºF and then sear them on a cast iron skillet.</p>
<p>While you are cooking the fish:</p>
<p>Heat a good-sized heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, adding the shallots, wine, vermouth, dashi-kombu, and stock to the pot all at once. Bring to a boil and adjust heat so it comes to a gently simmer. Cook down until the liquid is getting thick, almost syrupy. Prepare for it to take awhile if your stock is thin.</p>
<p>Pull the pan from the heat and remove the dashi-kombu, discarding or saving for another use.</p>
<p>Return the pan to the heat and add the crème fraiche or heavy cream. If using the former, cook just longer enough until it is thickened to just coat the back of a spoon. If using cream, this will take a bit longer, but simmer until the cream will lightly coat the back of a spoon.</p>
<p>Scatter the sorrel over the sauce and wilt the sorrel for 25 seconds. Pull the pan from the heat and add the butter, swirling the pan to melt and incorporate the butter into an emulsion. If you think you need to stir the sauce, use a wooden spoon, not a whisk, which will catch the sorrel. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a few drops of lemon juice and taste. The lemon juice should add a spark to the sauce. Add more if you think it needs it.</p>
<p>Use the sauce right away as it suffers if allowed to sit. If you need to, you can make the sauce up to the point where you remove the dashi-kombu. Then you can finish it quickly at the last minute.</p>
<p>When the fish is done remove it from the oven and carefully transfer to a platter or plates and cover with sauce. Fish may complete before sauce. If so, plate on warm plates.</p>
