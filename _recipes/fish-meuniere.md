<div class="row" id="row-two">	<div class="medium-4 small-5 columns" id="ingredients"><h4>Ingredients</h4><div class="box box-ingredients content"><ul>
<li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>4 fillets - I like sole, flounder, salmon. You can use anything that fillets well and doesn't fall apart when fried</li>
<li>2 Tbsp frying oil</li>
<li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li><strong>Brown Butter</strong></li>
<li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>¼ cup slivered almonds or other crushed nuts</li>
<li>1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
<li>1 ½ Tbsp lemon juice</li>
<li>1 lemon, cut in wedges for garnish</li>
</ul>
</div>	</div>	<div class="medium-6 small-7 columns" id="directions"><h4>Directions</h4><div class="box box-directions content"><p>Heat plates in microwave or in oven at 200ºF.</p>
<p>Season fish with salt and pepper. Let sit for 5 min or so.</p>
<p>Dredge fish in flour and place on baking sheet.</p>
<p>Heat frying oil in skillet (non-stick helps) over high heat. (I shoot for about 350ºF but you might fry smaller fish a bit higher. People tend to suggest 350ºF - 375ºF)</p>
<p>Add 1 Tbsp of butter and swirl and wait for foaming to subside. Put fish in. (Bone-side down for bigger fillets.) Reduce heat to medium and cook until golden brown and meat is opaque. If thick fish, measure with a probe and target 130 - 140ºF. This shouldn't take long. Maybe 2-3 min per side. Faster for smaller fish.</p>
<p>Transfer the fillets to heated plates and stick in oven at 200ºF if you have oven on.</p>
<p>Heat the 4 Tbsp of butter in a skillet over medium high heat until it melts. Should be about a minute. Add nuts and swirl until the butter is brown smells nutty - another minute or so.</p>
<p>Top the fish with parsley.</p>
<p>Add lemon juice to butter and season with salt. Cover fish with brown butter sauce and serve with lemon wedges.</p>
