description: "A no-fuss recipe that is revolutionizing home baking trades flavor and\
  \ reliability for ease. Could we improve the bread's bland taste and make it rise\
  \ high every time?\n\nTo avoid lengthy and tiresome kneading, we let our bread dough\
  \ sit for 8 to 18 hours, during which a process called autolysis develops gluten\u2014\
  the protein that gives baked breads their bubbly, chewy crumb structure. After that,\
  \ just 15 seconds of kneading does the trick. To give our bread more flavor than\
  \ standard no-knead recipes, we add vinegar for acidic tang and lager beer for extra\
  \ yeastiness. We bake the bread in a covered pot to create steam, producing a springy\
  \ interior, and then finish baking it uncovered for a beautifully browned crust."
