Second roast in the Anova Precision Oven since moving to Japan. Got the oxtail and a 3 kg rib roast. The mean was Kobe beef from 但馬玄 / tajimaguro. It was excellent. I made the [[oxtail-jus|Oxtail Jus]] for the sauce and used the standard [[prime-rib|Prime Rib]] recipe but targeted 135ºF because one diner wanted it a bit closer to medium than medium-rare.
