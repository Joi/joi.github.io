First real roast in the Anova Precision Oven since moving to Japan. Got the oxtail and a 3 kg rib roast from ミート工房拓味 (Meat Kounou Takumi). It was special [toman beef](https://toman-gyu.com/) that Shintaro introduced to us. It was excellent. I made the [[oxtail-jus|Oxtail Jus]] for the sauce and used the standard [[prime-rib|Prime Rib]] recipe but targeted 135ºF because one diner wanted it a bit closer to medium than medium-rare.
