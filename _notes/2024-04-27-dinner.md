Second roast in the Anova Precision Oven since moving to Japan. Got the oxtail and a 3 kg rib roast. The mean was Kobe beef from ä½†é¦¬çŽ„ / tajimaguro. It was excellent. I made the [[oxtail-jus|Oxtail Jus]] for the sauce and used a modified [[prime-rib|Prime Rib]] recipe but targeted 135ÂºF.

### Oxtail Au Jus

## Base Plan

Dry Brine 3 Days in Fridge

Sear surface of Prime Rib with torch to disinfect surface where probe is inserted

Start in 100% Anova Combi Oven at 145F for 1 hour to pasteurize surface

Then 8 hours at 135F until inside temperature reaches 134F

<aside>
ðŸ”¬ Although the Anova Recipe calls for 5 hours at 145F or so, doing a more traditional sous vide at the target temperature takes longer, but gives you more flexibility at the end and should be more tender. Adding 1 hour at 145F at the beginning should reduce microbial activity and eliminate the sometimes funky smell of long low-temperature reverse sears in the combi-oven.

</aside>

Make Oxtail Au Jus while prime rib is sous vide-ing. It should take about 4 hours.

Then Sear

<aside>
ðŸ”¬ Going to try the butter coating sear from the Sous Vide Ways recipe.

## Recipe Details

### Searing (From Sous Vide Ways Recipe)

1. Mix together softened butter, garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt and Lawry's seasoning salt together in a bowl until the compound butter is spreadable.
2. Remove bag from bath and immediate transfer the roast into an ice bath Let the roast chill for 10 minutes. Remove bag from ice bath, take rib roast out of the bag and thoroughly pat dry.
3. Preheat oven for 475F. Evenly coat garlic herbed compound butter on the entire prime rib. Place rib roast on a baking rack pan and cook for 15 minutes. Check with a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature is 110F or your desired serving temperature.
4. Remove rib roast from oven. Let rest for 5 minutes. If it is a bone-in roast, carefully carve off the bones making sure not to cut into the roast. Carve the prime rib into slabs and enjoy this heavenly piece of meat. *Pro tip - brush the excess butter and garlic mixture from the pan onto each piece before serving.
